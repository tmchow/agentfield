## [0.1.57-rc.1] - 2026-03-14


### Fixed

- Fix: capture stderr from Claude Code CLI for error diagnosis (#268)

* fix: capture stderr from Claude Code CLI for error diagnosis

The ClaudeCodeProvider was not passing a stderr callback to
ClaudeAgentOptions, so when the claude CLI exited with code 1,
the actual error message was lost. Logs only showed "Command
failed with exit code 1" with no actionable details.

Now passes a stderr callback that collects output and includes
it in both the error log and the RawResult.error_message field.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix: set stderr callback on opts object, not agent_options dict

Avoids test assertion failures caused by unexpected 'stderr' key
in the agent_options dictionary.

## [0.1.56-rc.1] - 2026-03-13


### Fixed

- Fix: prevent async executions from getting stuck in running state (#267)

Two issues caused async executions to remain in "running" state forever
when the reasoner failed:

1. SDK: asyncio.create_task() return values were not stored, making
   fire-and-forget tasks eligible for GC before the status callback
   could be delivered. Now stored in a set with auto-cleanup via
   done_callback. Also increased callback timeout from 10s to 30s
   since the shared httpx client's default is too aggressive for
   concurrent status updates over internal networking.

2. CP: stale execution reaper ran every 1h with a 30m timeout (worst
   case ~90min to clean up). Reduced to 5m interval with 10m timeout
   so stuck executions are marked as timed-out within 15 minutes.

## [0.1.55] - 2026-03-13

## [0.1.55-rc.1] - 2026-03-13


### Fixed

- Fix(sdk): tune rate limiter defaults for fail-fast behavior (#265)

Reduce exponential backoff aggressiveness to prevent 2+ hour workflow
runtimes when using rate-limited providers like OpenRouter. The previous
defaults (20 retries, 300s max delay, 300s circuit breaker) caused
cascading backoff that compounded across parallel agents.

New defaults: 5 retries, 0.5s base delay, 30s max delay, circuit breaker
threshold 5 with 30s timeout. Max theoretical wait per call drops from
~100 minutes to ~2.5 minutes.

Changes:
- Python StatelessRateLimiter: max_retries 20→5, base_delay 1.0→0.5,
  max_delay 300→30, circuit_breaker_threshold 10→5, timeout 300→30
- TypeScript StatelessRateLimiter: identical parameter changes
- AIConfig: updated Field defaults to match rate limiter
- Added functional tests validating new defaults and max wait bounds

## [0.1.54] - 2026-03-13

## [0.1.54-rc.2] - 2026-03-13


### Added

- Feat(sdk): surface cost_usd and usage from .ai() responses (#264)

* feat(sdk): surface cost_usd and usage from .ai() responses

MultimodalResponse now exposes cost_usd (estimated via litellm) and
usage (token counts) extracted from litellm response objects.  This
enables downstream consumers like pr-af to track .ai() call costs
instead of hardcoding them to zero.

### Documentation

- Docs: add UTM tracking to example project links in README

Replace direct GitHub links for SWE-AF, Deep Research, MongoDB, and
sec-af with tracked redirects through agentfield.ai/github/* routes
to measure README-driven traffic via Umami analytics. (96cbb77)

## [0.1.54-rc.1] - 2026-03-13


### Fixed

- Fix: reap stale workflow executions and use updated_at for staleness (#262)

* fix: reap stale workflow executions and use updated_at for staleness detection

The existing MarkStaleExecutions only covered the executions table and
used started_at to detect staleness, which missed orphaned workflow
executions entirely and could incorrectly timeout legitimately long-running
executions. This change:

- Switches staleness detection from started_at to updated_at so only
  executions with no recent activity are reaped
- Adds MarkStaleWorkflowExecutions to handle the workflow_executions
  table where orphaned child executions get permanently stuck in
  running state when their parent fails
- Wires both into the existing ExecutionCleanupService background loop

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* test: add functional tests for stale execution reaper with real SQLite

Tests run against a real database (no mocks) covering:
- Stuck executions reaped while active ones are preserved
- Long-running executions with recent activity NOT incorrectly reaped
- Orphaned workflow children reaped when parent already failed
- Waiting-state executions reaped after inactivity
- Batch limit respected across multiple reaper passes
- End-to-end scenario: parent fails, children stuck in both tables

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix: use COALESCE fallback for NULL updated_at in stale reaper queries

- Use COALESCE(updated_at, created_at, started_at) in both
  MarkStaleExecutions and MarkStaleWorkflowExecutions to handle
  rows where updated_at was never set
- Add invariant comment documenting that updated_at must be bumped
  on every meaningful activity for staleness detection to work
- Add tests for NULL updated_at scenario on both execution types

## [0.1.53] - 2026-03-12

## [0.1.53-rc.1] - 2026-03-12


### Fixed

- Fix: update estimate_cli_cost for litellm v1.80+ API (#261)

* fix: update estimate_cli_cost for litellm v1.80+ API

litellm removed prompt_tokens/completion_tokens kwargs from
completion_cost() in v1.80. Switch to prompt/completion string
params which litellm tokenizes internally.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix: update cost estimation test for litellm v1.80+ API

The test was asserting token_counter calls and prompt_tokens/completion_tokens
kwargs which were removed in the implementation fix. Update to match the new
prompt/completion string params API.

## [0.1.52] - 2026-03-12

## [0.1.52-rc.2] - 2026-03-12


### Added

- Feat: add token-based cost estimation for CLI harness providers (#260)

OpenCode, Gemini, and Codex providers now estimate LLM cost using
litellm's pricing database, so HarnessResult.cost_usd is no longer
always None for subprocess-based providers. This enables budget
enforcement and cost reporting in downstream consumers like pr-af.

## [0.1.52-rc.1] - 2026-03-11


### Fixed

- Fix: use status snapshot for node status endpoints to prevent flickering (#259)

GetNodeStatusHandler and BulkNodeStatusHandler were performing live HTTP
health checks on every call (1s cache for active agents). With the UI
polling every 3s, a single transient network failure in Railway would
immediately return "offline", causing agent status to flicker. Now uses
GetAgentStatusSnapshot which returns the stored status managed by the
background HealthMonitor (which has proper 3-consecutive-failure
debouncing and heartbeat gating). The explicit POST .../status/refresh
endpoint remains available for on-demand live checks.

## [0.1.51] - 2026-03-11

## [0.1.51-rc.2] - 2026-03-11


### Fixed

- Fix: wire ApplyEnvOverrides into server startup (#258)

* fix: wire ApplyEnvOverrides into server startup for Railway deployments

The applyEnvOverrides function (handling short env var names like
AGENTFIELD_CONNECTOR_ENABLED) was never called from the actual server
startup path. main.go uses Viper for config loading, but Viper's
AutomaticEnv only matches keys it already knows about from config files.
On Railway (no config file), ALL connector env vars were silently ignored,
causing connector routes to never be registered.

Export ApplyEnvOverrides and call it after Viper unmarshal so env vars
like AGENTFIELD_CONNECTOR_ENABLED, AGENTFIELD_CONNECTOR_TOKEN, and
capability flags (AGENTFIELD_CONNECTOR_CAP_*) work on file-less deploys.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* feat: add connector status routes for list_nodes and get_node_status

The connector's status handler was calling /api/v1/nodes (a regular API
endpoint requiring API key auth) instead of connector-scoped routes.
Added /api/v1/connector/nodes and /api/v1/connector/nodes/:id/status
routes gated by status_read capability, matching the pattern used by
other connector domains.

## [0.1.51-rc.1] - 2026-03-11


### Fixed

- Fix: add config_management to connector capability env var map (#257)

The connectorCapEnvMap was missing the config_management capability,
so AGENTFIELD_CONNECTOR_CAP_CONFIG_MANAGEMENT env var was silently
ignored. This caused connector config routes to not be accessible
when configured via environment variables (e.g. Railway deployments).

## [0.1.50] - 2026-03-10

## [0.1.50-rc.2] - 2026-03-10


### Fixed

- Fix: skip global API key check for connector routes (#255)

Connector routes have their own dedicated ConnectorTokenAuth middleware
that enforces X-Connector-Token with constant-time comparison. The global
APIKeyAuth middleware was incorrectly requiring the API key on these routes
too, forcing connectors to know and send the CP's global API key — a
credential they should never need.

This adds a prefix skip for /api/v1/connector/ in APIKeyAuth, matching
the existing pattern for /health, /ui, and /api/v1/did/ routes.

Also adds comprehensive functional tests for the full connector auth chain:
- ConnectorTokenAuth (valid/invalid/missing token, audit metadata injection)
- ConnectorCapabilityCheck (enabled/disabled/read-only/missing capabilities)
- Integration tests proving connector routes reject requests without a valid
  connector token, even though they bypass the global API key check

## [0.1.50-rc.1] - 2026-03-10


### Added

- Feat: database-backed configuration storage (#254)

* feat: database-backed configuration storage

Add ability to store and manage configuration files in the database
instead of (or in addition to) YAML files on disk. This enables
remote config management via the connector/SaaS flow.

- Add ConfigStorageModel with versioning and audit fields
- Implement SetConfig/GetConfig/ListConfigs/DeleteConfig in storage layer
- Add config CRUD API endpoints (GET/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/configs/:key)
- Add connector-scoped config routes gated by config_management capability
- Add AGENTFIELD_CONFIG_SOURCE=db flag to load config from database at startup
- Add Goose migration 028_create_config_storage.sql
- Works on both SQLite and PostgreSQL backends

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* feat: add hot-reload endpoint for database-backed configuration

Adds POST /configs/reload endpoint that re-applies database config
to the running control plane without requiring a process restart.
Only active when AGENTFIELD_CONFIG_SOURCE=db is set.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix: merge DB config fields individually to prevent zeroing out defaults

The ExecutionCleanup struct was being replaced wholesale when only
RetentionPeriod was set, zeroing out CleanupInterval and causing a
panic (non-positive interval for NewTicker). Now merges each field
individually. Also excludes connector config from DB merge since
token and capabilities are security-sensitive.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix: address critical security and correctness issues in config storage

- Add 1MB body size limit to SetConfig to prevent DoS via unbounded reads
- Add sync.RWMutex to protect config during hot-reload (prevents data race)
- Replace fragile string error check with errors.Is(err, sql.ErrNoRows)

## [0.1.49] - 2026-03-10


### Fixed

- Fix(install): BSD sed compatibility and env var pipe scoping in install.sh (#251)

Replace GNU-only \s with POSIX [[:space:]]* in get_latest_prerelease_version()
sed regex — \s is not recognized by macOS BSD sed, causing the version
string to contain raw JSON instead of just the tag name.

Fix documented VERSION/STAGING env var patterns: VAR=val cmd1 | cmd2
scopes VAR to cmd1 only (POSIX shell behavior), so bash never sees it.
Corrected to: curl ... | VERSION=X bash

Fixes #250 (96c3ae9)

## [0.1.49-rc.1] - 2026-03-09


### Fixed

- Fix: allow state transitions from stopping to active/starting

When a node restarts while the control plane still considers it
"stopping", heartbeats get rejected causing the node to be stuck
offline. Allow stopping → active/starting transitions so nodes
can recover from this state.

## [0.1.48] - 2026-03-09

## [0.1.48-rc.4] - 2026-03-09


### Fixed

- Fix(sdk): catch Pydantic ValidationError in structured output parsing

Pydantic v2 ValidationError does not inherit from ValueError, so schema
validation failures (e.g. missing required fields) were not caught by
the retry logic. This caused LLM responses with incomplete JSON to crash
the execution instead of retrying.

## [0.1.48-rc.3] - 2026-03-09


### Other

- Fix squished authorization table layout (#253)

* Fix squished authorization table layout

Widen the grid template columns for Status, Registered, and Actions
so they don't overlap. Use flexible sizing for Registered and Actions
columns to accommodate varying content widths.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* Fix authorization table: use fixed widths for right columns

The fr-based columns were consuming nearly all space, squeezing
Status/Registered/Actions into a tiny area. Use fixed px widths
for the right 3 columns (matching the pattern used by other tables)
so they get space allocated first before fr columns divide the rest.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* Fix Registered column wrapping and Actions column alignment

- Add whitespace-nowrap to Registered time and action buttons so
  "21 hours ago" and "Approve Reject" stay on one line
- Widen Actions column to 160px to fit both buttons
- Add "Actions" header label so all 6 columns have visible headers

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* Widen Actions column to 200px to fit Approve + Reject buttons

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* Reduce left column fr values to stop hogging space from right columns

All three flexible columns now use 1fr instead of 2fr/1.5fr, giving
equal weight and leaving more room for Status, Registered, and Actions.

- Supports --server, --token, --timeout, --json, --reason flags
- Human-readable output by default, raw JSON with --json
- User-friendly error messages for 404/409 status codes
- Registered under RootCmd in root.go

* feat(executor): enforce cancel/pause state in DAG executor (#242)

- callAgent checks execution status before making HTTP call
- Cancelled executions skip agent call and return early
- Paused executions block in waitForResume using event bus pattern
- waitForResume unblocks on ExecutionResumed (return nil) or
  ExecutionCancelledEvent (return error)
- Race condition guard: checks status before subscribing to event bus
- asyncExecutionJob.process also checks status before callAgent
- Tests: cancel skip, pause+resume flow, pause+cancel flow, async job skip

* feat(ui): add cancel/pause/resume controls to workflow header (#243)

- Add Cancel, Pause, Resume buttons to EnhancedWorkflowHeader
- Cancel uses AlertDialog confirmation (destructive action guard)
- Pause/Resume use ghost buttons with amber/emerald hover states
- Mobile-responsive: icon-only on small screens, icon+label on desktop
- Loading spinners during mutations, all buttons disabled while mutating
- API client functions in executionsApi.ts for cancel/pause/resume
- Routes registered under UI API group in server.go
- NotificationProvider wraps workflow detail page for toast feedback
- New alert-dialog.tsx component (shadcn/Radix pattern)

* fix(storage): add missing 'waiting' status to SQLite and PostgreSQL CHECK constraints

The 'waiting' status (used by HITL approval flow) was a valid canonical status
in Go code but was missing from database CHECK constraints. This would cause
INSERT/UPDATE failures when executions transition to 'waiting' state.

Fixes both SQLite (local.go) and PostgreSQL (migration 027) constraints.

* fix(ui): add paused status to all CanonicalStatus Record maps

WorkflowNode, HoverDetailPanel, StatusSection, EnhancedWorkflowIdentity,
and ExecutionHistoryList all had Record<CanonicalStatus, ...> maps missing
the 'paused' entry, causing TypeScript build failures.

* refactor(ui): redesign cancel/pause/resume as icon-only toolbar buttons

Match existing toolbar convention (ghost variant, h-8 w-8, title tooltips).
Remove text labels and destructive variant to reduce visual weight.
Add separator between execution controls and view controls.
Keeps AlertDialog confirmation for cancel safety.

* fix(ui): fix paused priority in deriveOverallStatus and move graph controls to floating toolbar

- Fix deriveOverallStatus() to prioritize paused over running (deliberate user
  action takes precedence over child execution state)
- Add 2 test cases for paused priority behavior
- Move viewMode (Standard/Performance/Debug) and Focus mode from header to
  bottom-left floating toolbar in graph view
- Update EnhancedWorkflowDetailPage prop wiring for toolbar migration

* feat(ui): add execution lifecycle controls, live duration, and status filter enhancements

- Redesign CompactExecutionHeader with pause/cancel/resume icon buttons,
  live elapsed time counter, refresh button, and hover card for secondary
  details (agent, DID, workflow, input/output sizes)
- Wrap EnhancedExecutionDetailPage with NotificationProvider for toast
  notifications on pause/cancel/resume actions
- Add live elapsed time display to EnhancedWorkflowHeader for running and
  paused workflows (replaces N/A with real-time counter)
- Add Paused and Cancelled to STATUS_FILTER_OPTIONS in PageHeader
- Add paused to statusLabels in CompactWorkflowsTable

* fix(ui): single-line headers and fix unicode triangle rendering

- Convert two-line name+subtitle layout to single-line in both
  workflow and execution detail page headers
- Replace HTML entity &blacktriangle; with Unicode ▲ (JSX compat)
- Replace &bull; separators with Unicode middle dot (·)
- Remove unused Clock import from CompactExecutionHeader
- Name appears bold, metadata appears muted on same line

* fix(ui): human-readable durations, visible agent_node_id, LIVE badge → refresh dot

- Replace local formatDuration with shared formatDurationHumanReadable
  (e.g. 4487.0m → 3d 2h, 74h 43m → 3d 2h)
- Show agent_node_id as distinct mono chip next to reasoner name
- Remove standalone LIVE/IDLE badges from both headers
- Add green pulsing dot on refresh button when execution is live
- Clean up unused Clock import and underscore unused props

* fix(ui): show agent_node_id in workflow header, remove steps/depth clutter

- Extract root agent_node_id from DAG timeline data
- Display as mono chip next to workflow name (same style as execution page)
- Remove 'N steps · depth N' metadata (not useful to users)
- Keep duration with live indicator and run ID for copying
- Update mobile row to match desktop layout

* feat(ui): redesign execution and workflow headers into 2-row layout

Restructure both detail page headers from single-row into a
semantically-organized 2-row layout with proper information hierarchy,
responsive behavior, and mobile support.

Row 1: status cluster + identity cluster + lifecycle controls
Row 2: section navigation tabs (absorbed from separate components) + summary metrics

- Rewrite CompactExecutionHeader with status dot, identity chips,
  tooltips, controlled cancel AlertDialog, and mobile overflow menu
- Rewrite EnhancedWorkflowHeader with webhook HoverCard, active/failed
  badges, fullscreen toggle, and graph depth metrics
- Move tab navigation into headers (remove standalone tab components)
- Add mobile 3-row stacked layout with DropdownMenu overflow
- Update both detail pages to pass tab props to headers

* fix(test): resolve data race in execution cleanup test

Use thread-safe syncBuffer for concurrent log writes from cleanup
goroutine and Stop() goroutine. The bytes.Buffer is not safe for
concurrent writes, causing race detector failures on CI.

* fix: address code review issues in cancel/pause/resume feature

- Add 24h timeout to waitForResume in async execution path to prevent
  goroutine leaks when resume/cancel events are never delivered
- Use unique subscriber IDs (with nanosecond suffix) to prevent event
  bus collisions when parallel DAG branches wait on same execution
- Change CancelExecutionHandler to accept ExecutionStore interface
  instead of storage.StorageProvider for interface segregation
- Fix pause response Reason field to use *string (matching cancel
  response) so empty reasons are omitted from JSON via omitempty
- Remove debug console.log from executionsApi.ts that leaked execution
  data to browser console in production

* feat(ui): redesign workflow DAG graph toolbar (#248)

* feat(ui): redesign workflow DAG toolbar with unified GraphToolbar component

Replace scattered graph controls (layout buttons, search, center, fit view,
view mode toggle, focus mode) with a single compact icon-based toolbar.

- Add GraphToolbar component with layout/view mode dropdowns, search, focus,
  and smart center buttons using Phosphor icons with tooltips
- Implement wrapped tree layout in LayoutManager for wide-branching DAGs
  (wraps 50+ siblings into rows of N columns targeting ~1600px width)
- Remove duplicate mrtree layout (keep Dagre tree as single tree option)
- Extend WorkflowDAGControls with changeLayout() and onLayoutInfoChange
- Simplify VirtualizedDAG by removing layout-related props
- Remove SLOW warning badges, replace with subtle 'slower' text in dropdown
- Unify default layout to tree for all graph sizes

* fix(ui): clean up dead code and unused props from toolbar redesign

- Delete LayoutControls.tsx (fully replaced by GraphToolbar, zero imports remain)
- Remove unused isFullscreen prop from EnhancedWorkflowFlowProps and call site
- Clean blank line artifacts left from removed Panel blocks

* fix(handlers): move state validation inside update callbacks to eliminate TOCTOU race

The cancel/pause/resume handlers previously checked execution state
before the atomic update callback, allowing concurrent requests to
slip through. Now the state check happens inside the callback where
it reads the locked current value, and state-conflict errors are
properly mapped to 409 Conflict instead of 500.

- Fix(ui): center sidebar nav icons when collapsed (#247)

Remove redundant px-2 from SidebarContent that stacked with

### Fixed

- Fix: include API key in note() request headers (#235)

* fix: include API key in note() request headers

The note() method was sending execution context headers but
not the X-API-Key, causing 401 when the control plane has
API key auth enabled (production). Works locally because
local dev typically has no API key configured.

* Fix test stub to include _get_auth_headers on client

The test_note_sends_async_request test was failing because the agent
stub's client (SimpleNamespace) lacked the _get_auth_headers method
added in the note auth fix. The _send_note coroutine calls
self.client._get_auth_headers(), which raised AttributeError and
silently prevented the HTTP post from executing.

local dev typically has no API key configured.

### Documentation

- Docs: add AI tool calling documentation to READMEs (#231)

Document the new native LLM tool-calling feature (PR #228) in the main
README and all three SDK READMEs with examples showing auto-discovery,
filtered discovery, lazy hydration, guardrails, and observability.

## [0.1.46] - 2026-03-05

## [0.1.46-rc.2] - 2026-03-05


### Added

- Feat: native LLM tool-calling support via discover → ai → call pipeline (#228)

* feat: add native LLM tool-calling support via discover → ai → call pipeline (#225)

Add tools= parameter to app.ai() that enables automatic tool-call loops:
discover available capabilities, convert to LLM tool schemas, dispatch
calls via app.call(), and feed results back until the LLM produces a
final response.

Python SDK:
- New tool_calling module with capability-to-schema converters
- Tool-call execution loop with multi-turn support
- Progressive discovery (lazy schema hydration)
- Guardrails (max_turns, max_tool_calls)
- Per-call observability (ToolCallTrace with latency tracking)

Go SDK:
- Tool types (ToolDefinition, ToolCall) on ai.Request/Response
- CapabilitiesToToolDefinitions converter
- ExecuteToolCallLoop on ai.Client
- AIWithTools convenience method on Agent
- WithTools option for ai.Request

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix(sdk/python): harden tool-calling DX — rate limiting, stream guard, typed response

- Wrap tool-calling LLM calls with rate limiter and model fallbacks
  (previously bypassed both, causing naked 429 failures in production)
- Guard stream=True + tools= with clear ValueError
- Type tools parameter with Union instead of Any for IDE discoverability
- Replace monkey-patched _tool_call_trace with typed ToolCallResponse wrapper
  (exposes .trace, .text, .response with __getattr__ delegation)
- Track hydration_retries in ToolCallTrace for lazy hydration observability
- Add ToolCallResponse tests and update existing tests

Refs: #225, #229

* fix(test): update harness schema test to match #230 prompt wording change

* feat: add TS SDK tool-calling parity, lazy hydration, examples, and E2E-tested fixes

- TypeScript SDK: ToolCalling.ts with full discover/filter/lazy/guardrails pipeline
- TypeScript SDK: lazy hydration uses non-executable selection pass then hydrates
- TypeScript SDK: OpenRouter/Ollama use .chat() API (not Responses API)
- TypeScript SDK: ReasonerContext.aiWithTools() for ctx-level tool calling
- Python SDK: fix invocation_target→call_target conversion in tool dispatch
- Python/TS: tool name sanitization (colons→double underscores) for LLM compat
- Examples: Python + TS orchestrator/worker/test covering all Sam's #225 cases
- E2E tested with GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 2.0 Flash via OpenRouter

* fix(examples): use ctx.input and app.serve() in TS worker example

SkillHandler receives a single SkillContext arg — input lives on ctx.input,
not as a second parameter. Also fix app.run() → app.serve() to match the
TS SDK's actual API. Found during E2E manual testing.

## [0.1.46-rc.1] - 2026-03-05


### Fixed

- Fix(harness): add concurrency limiter, stdout fallback, and stronger prompts (#230)

Root cause: unbounded concurrent opencode subprocess calls (20+) overwhelm
the LLM API, causing transient failures where output files are never created.

Changes:
- opencode.py: add global asyncio.Semaphore (default 3, configurable via
  OPENCODE_MAX_CONCURRENT) to throttle concurrent opencode run processes;
  add 600s timeout; add structured logging for finish/error states
- _schema.py: strengthen output prompt to emphasize Write tool usage;
  add try_parse_from_text() fallback that extracts JSON from LLM stdout
  when the output file is missing (fenced blocks, brace matching, cosmetic repair)
- _runner.py: wire stdout fallback after parse_and_validate in both initial
  and retry paths

Validated: full SEC-AF pipeline (11 hunt strategies, 30 verified findings)
completes end-to-end with 0 enricher failures, vs repeated failures before. (2947d5b)

## [0.1.45] - 2026-03-05

## [0.1.45-rc.8] - 2026-03-05


### Fixed

- Fix(did): add did:web resolution to document endpoint (#227)

* fix(did): add did:web resolution to /api/v1/did/document/:did endpoint

The GetDIDDocument handler only resolved did:key identities via the
in-memory registry. did:web lookups returned "DID not found" even when
the agent had a valid did:web document stored in the database.

Add did:web resolution (via didWebService) before falling back to
did:key, matching the pattern already used by the ResolveDID handler
and the server's serveDIDDocument method.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix(did): normalize URL-decoded %3A in did:web path params

Gin URL-decodes path parameters, turning did:web:localhost%3A8080:agents:foo
into did:web:localhost:8080:agents:foo. The database stores the canonical
form with %3A, so lookups failed with "DID not found".

Add normalizeDIDWeb() helper that detects decoded port separators and
re-encodes them. Applied to both ResolveDID and GetDIDDocument handlers.

Manually verified against running control plane:
- /api/v1/did/document/did:web:... → 200 with W3C DID Document
- /api/v1/did/resolve/did:web:... → 200 with DID resolution result
- did:key paths unchanged (no regression)

### Added

- Feat(ui): display both did:key and did:web identities (#226)

* feat(ui): display both did:key and did:web identities with clear distinction

The UI previously only showed did:key identifiers, making did:web
identities invisible to users who need them for JWT and external
integrations.

Backend: Wire DIDWebService into UI DIDHandler and return did_web
in the node DID API response.

Frontend: Show both identity types as clearly separated sections
with descriptive labels — "Cryptographic Identity" (did:key) for
signing/auth, and "Web Identity" (did:web) for JWT/external use.
Each has its own copy button and View Document action.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix(ui): add did:web to identity API and fix unused import

Wire DIDWebService into IdentityHandlers so the DID Explorer page
returns did_web alongside did:key. Remove unused Analytics import
that was breaking CI builds.

### Added

- Feat(ai): retry LLM calls on malformed structured output JSON (#224)

When using schema-based structured output, LLMs occasionally return
malformed JSON that fails parsing. This adds automatic retry (up to 2
retries) specifically for parse failures, avoiding unnecessary retries
for network or API errors.

Co-authored-by: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com> (a462b3a)

## [0.1.45-rc.4] - 2026-03-05


### Added

- Feat(harness): OpenCode support with schema retry, error preservation, and project_dir routing (#220)

* feat(harness): add schema output diagnosis and enhanced follow-up prompts

Add diagnose_output_failure() that classifies validation failures into
specific categories: file missing, empty, invalid JSON, or schema mismatch
with field-level diff. Enhance build_followup_prompt() to include schema
file references and explicit rewrite instructions for the retry loop.

* feat(harness): add schema validation retry loop with session continuity

Replace single-shot _handle_schema_output() with _handle_schema_with_retry()
that retries up to schema_max_retries times (default 2) when JSON validation
fails. Each retry:
  - Diagnoses the specific failure via diagnose_output_failure()
  - Sends a follow-up prompt to the agent with error context
  - For Claude: passes resume=session_id to continue the conversation
  - For CLI providers: fresh call with the follow-up prompt
  - Accumulates cost, turns, and messages across all attempts

This activates the previously dead-code build_followup_prompt() from _schema.py
and adds resume_session_id support to the Claude Code provider.

* test(harness): add complex JSON schema debug test script

Standalone script exercising the harness with 5 escalating schema levels:
  - simple (2 fields), medium (lists + optionals), complex (13 nested fields),
    deeply_nested (recursive TreeNode), massive (>4K tokens, file-based path)
Tested live with both claude-code and codex providers — all levels pass.
Includes manual retry test mode (--retry-test) to exercise the new retry loop.

* feat(harness): add opencode provider with project_dir routing

- Rewrite opencode.py: auto-managed serve+attach pattern to bypass
  opencode v1.2.10-v1.2.16 'Session not found' bug
- Add project_dir field to HarnessConfig (types.py) so coding agents
  explore the target repo instead of a temp working directory
- Add output file placement inside project_dir (runner) so sandboxed
  Write tool can reach the output JSON
- Pass server_url to OpenCodeProvider via factory
- Clean up debug prints from runner and claude provider
- Verified working with openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5 model

* fix(harness): update opencode provider tests for serve+attach pattern

Tests now pass server_url to skip auto-serve lifecycle in CI where
opencode binary is not installed. Asserts updated to match --attach
command structure.

* fix(harness): use direct opencode run for auto-approve permissions

opencode run --attach loses auto-approve because the serve process
treats attached sessions as interactive, causing permission prompts
to hang forever when the model tries to write files.

* fix(harness): align opencode tests with direct run (no --attach)

* fix(harness): crash-safe retry with FailureType classification

- Add FailureType enum (NONE, CRASH, TIMEOUT, API_ERROR, SCHEMA, NO_OUTPUT)
  to RawResult and HarnessResult for intelligent retry decisions
- Fix returncode masking in run_cli: preserve negative signal values
- Add strip_ansi() to clean ANSI escape codes from stderr
- Crash-aware retry in _handle_schema_with_retry: retryable failures
  (CRASH, NO_OUTPUT) get full prompt re-send instead of immediate bail
- build_followup_prompt now accepts optional schema param, inlines schema
  JSON, removed poisonous empty-array hint that caused flat schema failures
- Exponential backoff between schema retries (0.5s base, 5s max)
- Apply same crash classification pattern to opencode, codex, gemini providers
- Update opencode provider test for XDG_DATA_HOME env injection

* fix(harness): remove double-close bug and dead serve code

- write_schema_file: remove try/except that double-closed fd after
  os.fdopen() already took ownership (caused EBADF on write failure)
- opencode.py: remove ~100 lines of unused serve+attach machinery
  (_ensure_serve, _cleanup_serve, _find_free_port, class-level
  singleton state) — execute() uses direct `opencode run` and never
  called any of it

- Feat(readme): replace text examples table with visual showcase cards (#216)

Add 3-column visual 'Built With AgentField' section with premium
editorial images for Autonomous Engineering Team, Deep Research Engine,
and Reactive MongoDB Intelligence. Moved higher in README (after
'What is AgentField?') for better visibility. Removed old text-only
Production Examples table. (b9add36)



### Chores

- Chore(readme): remove redundant horizontal rules

GitHub already renders ## headings with visual separation.
The 11 --- rules created double-spacing that made the README choppy. (48baf65)

## [0.1.45-rc.3] - 2026-03-04


### Added

- Feat(webhook): support all HITL template response formats (#213)

* feat(webhook): support all HITL template response formats and multi-pause workflows

The webhook approval handler previously only extracted the "decision" field
from template responses, causing templates that use "action" (confirm-action,
rich-text-editor) or have no explicit decision field (signature-capture) to
fail silently.

Changes:
- Extract decision from "action" field as fallback when "decision" is absent
- Default completed webhooks with no decision/action to "approved"
- Add normalizeDecision() to map template-specific values (approve, confirm,
  reject, deny, abort, cancel) to canonical set (approved/rejected)
- Clear approval request fields on "approved" (not just "request_changes")
  to support multi-pause workflows where agents issue sequential approvals
- Add localhost:8001 to CORS allowed origins for demo UIs

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix: preserve ApprovalRequestID on approved for idempotency and multi-pause

The previous commit cleared ApprovalRequestID on both "approved" and
"request_changes" decisions. This broke:
- Idempotent webhook retries (lookup by request ID returned 404)
- Approval-status queries (same lookup failure)
- Callback notifications (in-memory store shared pointer was mutated)

Fix:
- Only clear ApprovalRequestID on "request_changes" (as before)
- On "approved", clear URL fields but preserve the request ID
- Save callback URL before the update closure to avoid shared-pointer
  aliasing in stores that mutate objects in-place
- Make request-approval handler multi-pause aware: check ApprovalStatus
  is "pending" (not just ApprovalRequestID existence) so agents can
  re-request approval after a resolved round

- Universal file-write: always instruct agent to write JSON to {cwd}/.agentfield_output.json
- Prompt suffix generation (inline for small schemas, file-based for large >4K tokens)
- Cosmetic JSON repair: strip markdown fences, trailing commas, truncated brackets
- Full parse+validate pipeline with Layer 1 (direct) + Layer 2 (repair) fallback
- Pydantic v1/v2 + Zod schema support
- Python: 19 tests, TypeScript: 18 tests

Closes #200

* feat(harness): add HarnessRunner with retry and schema orchestration (#201)

- Config resolution: merge HarnessConfig defaults + per-call overrides
- Exponential backoff + jitter retry for transient errors (rate limits, 5xx, timeouts)
- Schema orchestration: prompt suffix injection, Layer 1+2 parse/validate
- Guaranteed temp file cleanup in finally block
- Cost/metrics/session tracking in HarnessResult

Closes #201

* feat(harness): add Claude Code and Codex providers with shared CLI utilities (#202, #203)

- Claude Code provider: Python uses claude_agent_sdk (lazy import), TS uses @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk (dynamic import)
- Codex provider: Python + TS use CLI subprocess with shared async utilities
- Shared CLI module: run_cli, parse_jsonl, extract_final_text for subprocess management
- All providers implement HarnessProvider protocol with execute() method
- 14 Python tests + 12 TypeScript tests, all passing (97 total)

* feat(harness): wire .harness() into Agent class with lazy runner (#204)

- Python: harness_config constructor param, lazy harness_runner property, async harness() method
- TypeScript: harnessConfig in AgentConfig, lazy getHarnessRunner(), async harness() method
- Package exports: HarnessConfig + HarnessResult from agentfield.__init__
- 8 Python + 6 TypeScript wiring tests, all passing (111 total)

* feat(harness): add Gemini CLI and OpenCode providers (#205, #206)

- Gemini provider: CLI subprocess with -p prompt, --sandbox auto, -m model flags
- OpenCode provider: CLI subprocess with --non-interactive, --model flags
- Factory updated to route all 4 providers: claude-code, codex, gemini, opencode

- 10 Python + 10 TypeScript new tests, all passing (131 total)

* fix(harness): address review feedback — lazy imports, trimmed exports, file permissions

- Remove eager provider imports from Python providers/__init__.py (lazy loading preserved via factory)
- Trim public API exports in Python harness/__init__.py and TypeScript harness/index.ts to only public types
- Add 0o600 file permissions for schema/output files in _schema.py and schema.ts
- Fix TypeScript type errors in runner.ts (tsc --noEmit clean)

* feat(harness): add functional tests, fix provider bugs for Claude and OpenCode

- Add 12 Python + 6 TypeScript functional tests invoking real coding agents
- Fix Claude Code permission_mode mapping (auto → bypassPermissions)
- Fix OpenCode CLI command (--non-interactive → run subcommand)
- Mark OpenCode tests as xfail (upstream v1.2.10 headless bug)
- Add harness_live pytest marker, excluded from default runs
- Update unit test expectations for provider command changes

Tested: Codex 4/4 ✅, Claude Code 4/4 ✅, cross-provider ✅
OpenCode: upstream 'Session not found' bug (not our code)

* perf(harness): fix import/allocation regression — lazy imports, WeakMap, async factory

- TS: Replace eager HarnessRunner import with dynamic import() in Agent.ts
- TS: Use WeakMap instead of class property for _harnessRunner (keeps V8 inline)
- TS: Make buildProvider async with per-provider dynamic imports in factory.ts
- Python: Move HarnessRunner import to TYPE_CHECKING + lazy import in property
- Update all 8 test files for async buildProvider/getHarnessRunner changes
- All 131 unit tests passing (69 Python + 62 TypeScript)
- tsc --noEmit clean

* fix(harness): use typing.List for Python 3.8 compat in functional test

Pydantic evaluates annotations at runtime via eval(), so list[str]
(PEP 585) fails on Python 3.8 even with 'from __future__ import
annotations'. Use typing.List[str] instead.

* feat(harness): add optional 'harness' and 'harness-claude' extras in pyproject.toml

Users can now install the Claude Code SDK dependency declaratively:
  pip install agentfield[harness]        # all harness provider deps
  pip install agentfield[harness-claude]  # just Claude Code SDK

Codex, Gemini, and OpenCode are CLI binaries — no pip packages needed.

### Added

- Feat: waiting state with approval workflows, VC-based authorization, and multi-version reasoners (#197)

* feat(control-plane): add VC-based authorization foundation

This commit introduces the foundation for the new VC-based authorization
system that replaces API key distribution with admin-approved permissions.

Key components added:
- Architecture documentation (docs/VC_AUTHORIZATION_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Database migrations for permission approvals, DID documents, and protected agents
- Core types for permissions and did:web support
- DIDWebService for did:web generation, storage, and resolution
- PermissionService for permission requests, approvals, and VC issuance

The system enables:
- Agents self-assigning tags (identity declaration)
- Admin approval workflow for protected agent access
- Real-time revocation via did:web
- Control plane as source of truth for approvals

* fix(control-plane): fix pre-existing test bugs exposed by FTS5 build tag

The CI workflow change from `go test ./...` to `go test -tags sqlite_fts5 ./...`
caused previously-skipped tests to execute, revealing 15 pre-existing bugs:

- UI handler tests: Register agents in storage and configure mocks for
  GetAgentStatus calls; fix assertions to match actual behavior (health
  check failures mark agents inactive, not error the request)
- VC service tests: Fix GetWorkflowVC lookups to use workflow_vc_id not
  workflow_id; fix issuer mismatch test to tamper VCDocument JSON instead
  of metadata field; fix error message assertion for empty VC documents
- VC storage tests: Fix GetWorkflowVC key lookups; fix empty result assertions
- PresenceManager tests: Register agents in storage so markInactive ->
  UpdateAgentStatus -> GetAgentStatusSnapshot -> GetAgent succeeds; add
  proper sync.Mutex for callback vars; use require.Eventually instead of
  time.Sleep; set HardEvictTTL for lease deletion test
- Webhook storage: Fix hardcoded Pending status to use webhook.Status
- Execution records test: Fix LatestStarted assertion (CreateExecutionRecord
  overwrites updated_at with time.Now())
- Cleanup test: Wire countWorkflowRuns and deleteWorkflowRuns into
  workflow cleanup path

* fix(control-plane): fix SSE tests leaking goroutines via incorrect context cancellation

Multiple SSE tests called req.Context().Done() expecting it to cancel the
context, but Done() only returns a channel — it doesn't cancel anything.
This caused SSE handler goroutines to block forever, leaking and eventually
causing a 10-minute test timeout in CI.

Fixed all affected tests to use context.WithCancel + explicit cancel() call,
matching the pattern already used by the working SSE tests.

Tests expected the old 3-header format ({timestamp}:{bodyHash}) but the
implementation correctly uses 4 headers with nonce ({timestamp}:{nonce}:{bodyHash}),
matching Go and Python SDKs.

* fix: add rate limiting to DID auth middleware on execution endpoints

Addresses code scanning alert about missing rate limiting on the
authorization route handler. Adds a sliding-window rate limiter
(30 requests per IP per 60s) to the local verification middleware.

* fix: use express-rate-limit for DID auth middleware to satisfy CodeQL

Replace custom Map-based rate limiter with express-rate-limit package,
which CodeQL recognizes as a proper rate limiting implementation.

* multi versioning connector setup

* add agent to agent direct checks

* bugfixes on connector

* QA fixes

* package lock

* bug fixes on permissions & versioning flow

* fix: add missing DeleteAgentVersion stub and guard postgres migration for fresh DBs

Two CI failures:

1. linux-tests: stubStorage in server_routes_test.go was missing the
   DeleteAgentVersion method added to the StorageProvider interface
   by the multi-version work. Add the stub.

2. Functional Tests (postgres): migrateAgentNodesCompositePKPostgres
   tried to ALTER TABLE agent_nodes before GORM created it on fresh
   databases. The information_schema.columns query returns count=0
   (not an error) when the table doesn't exist, so the function
   proceeded to run ALTER statements against a nonexistent table.
   Add an explicit table existence check matching the pattern already
   used by the SQLite migration path.

* fix: resolve Python and TypeScript SDK test failures

Python SDK:
- Add pytest-httpx dependency (with Python >=3.10 constraint)
- Register httpx_mock marker for --strict-markers compatibility
- Add importorskip for graceful skip on Python <3.10
- Fix request_approval test calls to match actual API signature

## [0.1.43] - 2026-03-02

## [0.1.43-rc.1] - 2026-03-02


### Added

- Feat: VC-based authorization, sidecar management APIs, and multi-version reasoners (#188)

* feat(control-plane): add VC-based authorization foundation

This commit introduces the foundation for the new VC-based authorization
system that replaces API key distribution with admin-approved permissions.

Key components added:
- Architecture documentation (docs/VC_AUTHORIZATION_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Database migrations for permission approvals, DID documents, and protected agents
- Core types for permissions and did:web support
- DIDWebService for did:web generation, storage, and resolution
- PermissionService for permission requests, approvals, and VC issuance

The system enables:
- Agents self-assigning tags (identity declaration)
- Admin approval workflow for protected agent access
- Real-time revocation via did:web
- Control plane as source of truth for approvals

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* feat(vc-authorization): complete VC-based authorization system implementation

- Add DID authentication middleware with Ed25519 signature verification
- Add permission checking middleware for protected agent enforcement
- Implement admin API handlers for permission management (approve/reject/revoke)
- Add permission request and check API endpoints
- Implement storage layer for DID documents, permission approvals, protected agent rules
- Add comprehensive integration test suite (14 test functions covering all phases)
- Add Admin UI pages: PendingPermissions, PermissionHistory, ProtectedAgents
- Add Go SDK DID authentication support
- Add Python SDK DID authentication support
- Fix CI to enable FTS5 tests (previously all SQLite-dependent tests were skipped)
- Add security documentation for DID authentication
- Add implementation guide documentation

* fix(control-plane): fix pre-existing test bugs exposed by FTS5 build tag

TestGetNodeDetailsHandler_Structure expected HTTP 400 for missing route
param but Gin returns 404. TestGetNodeStatusHandler_Structure was missing
a mock expectation for GetAgentStatus causing a panic.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix(control-plane): fix pre-existing test bugs exposed by FTS5 build tag

The CI workflow change from `go test ./...` to `go test -tags sqlite_fts5 ./...`
caused previously-skipped tests to execute, revealing 15 pre-existing bugs:

- UI handler tests: Register agents in storage and configure mocks for
  GetAgentStatus calls; fix assertions to match actual behavior (health
  check failures mark agents inactive, not error the request)
- VC service tests: Fix GetWorkflowVC lookups to use workflow_vc_id not
  workflow_id; fix issuer mismatch test to tamper VCDocument JSON instead
  of metadata field; fix error message assertion for empty VC documents
- VC storage tests: Fix GetWorkflowVC key lookups; fix empty result assertions
- PresenceManager tests: Register agents in storage so markInactive ->
  UpdateAgentStatus -> GetAgentStatusSnapshot -> GetAgent succeeds; add
  proper sync.Mutex for callback vars; use require.Eventually instead of
  time.Sleep; set HardEvictTTL for lease deletion test
- Webhook storage: Fix hardcoded Pending status to use webhook.Status
- Execution records test: Fix LatestStarted assertion (CreateExecutionRecord
  overwrites updated_at with time.Now())
- Cleanup test: Wire countWorkflowRuns and deleteWorkflowRuns into
  workflow cleanup path

* fix(control-plane): fix SSE tests leaking goroutines via incorrect context cancellation

Multiple SSE tests called req.Context().Done() expecting it to cancel the
context, but Done() only returns a channel — it doesn't cancel anything.
This caused SSE handler goroutines to block forever, leaking and eventually
causing a 10-minute test timeout in CI.

Fixed all affected tests to use context.WithCancel + explicit cancel() call,
matching the pattern already used by the working SSE tests.

target). Enable authorization in the default config with seeded protection
rules.

* fix(sdk-python): update test fakes for DID credential wiring in _register_agent_with_did

The previous commit added identity_package access and client credential
wiring to _register_agent_with_did but didn't update the test fakes.
_FakeDIDManager now provides a realistic identity_package and
_FakeAgentFieldClient supports set_did_credentials, so the full
registration path is exercised in tests.

- Fix empty caller_agent_id: add DID registry fallback in
  ResolveAgentIDByDID for did:key resolution (did_service.go, did_web_service.go)
- Fix HTTP 200 for failed executions: return 502 with proper error details
  when inner agent-to-agent calls fail (execute.go)

## [Unreleased] - feat/connector

### Added

- **Multi-Versioning**: Deploy multiple versions of the same agent with weighted traffic routing. Agents are now stored with composite primary key `(id, version)`, enabling canary deployments, A/B testing, and blue-green rollouts. Includes `group_id` for logical grouping, `traffic_weight` (0–10000) per version, weighted round-robin selection, and `X-Routed-Version` response header. New storage methods: `GetAgentVersion`, `ListAgentVersions`, `ListAgentGroups`, `ListAgentsByGroup`, `UpdateAgentTrafficWeight`, `DeleteAgentVersion`. (9db17be, 9ae4e62, 3d6a50b)

- **VC-Based Authorization System**: Complete Verifiable Credential authorization with W3C DID identity, Ed25519 request signing, tag-based access policies, and admin approval workflows. Agents get `did:web` identities with keypairs derived from master seed. Request signing uses 4 headers (`X-Caller-DID`, `X-DID-Signature`, `X-DID-Timestamp`, `X-DID-Nonce`). Includes DID auth middleware, permission check middleware with auto-request-on-deny, admin API for approve/reject/revoke, and comprehensive integration test suite (1754+ lines). (0cde0b1, 0106624)

- **Connector Subsystem**: External management API with token-based authentication and capability-based access control. Provides `/connector/*` REST endpoints for managing reasoners, versions, traffic weights, and agent groups. Supports scoped capabilities (`reasoners:read`, `versions:write`, `restart`, etc.) for CI/CD and orchestration platform integration. (3d6a50b, 9ae4e62)

- **Authorization Admin UI**: Unified tabbed authorization page with Access Rules tab (ALLOW/DENY policies with color-coded borders), Agent Tags tab (manage and approve agent tags), approval dialogs with policy impact preview, and revocation support. (4ac437f)

- **Agent-to-Agent Direct Verification**: SDK `LocalVerifier` modules that cache policies, revocation lists, registered DIDs, and admin public key from the control plane. Enables offline signature verification without round-tripping. Added `/api/v1/registered-dids` endpoint. Supports nonce-based signatures and `did:key` public key resolution. (d89eb23)

- **SDK DID Auth Modules**:
  - Go: `client/did_auth.go` (authenticator), `did/did_client.go` (DID client), `did/did_manager.go` (key manager), `did/vc_generator.go` (VC generation), `agent/verification.go` (LocalVerifier)
  - Python: `did_auth.py` (Ed25519 signing), `verification.py` (LocalVerifier with async refresh)
  - TypeScript: Expanded `LocalVerifier.ts` (registered DID caching, nonce-aware verification)

- **SDK Version Propagation**: All three SDKs (Go, Python, TypeScript) now include `version` in heartbeat and shutdown payloads for multi-versioning support.

- **Multi-Version Examples**: New examples for all three SDKs demonstrating versioned agent registration (`examples/ts-node-examples/multi-version/`, `examples/go_agent_nodes/cmd/multi_version/`, `examples/python_agent_nodes/multi_version/`)

- **Permission Test Examples**: Caller + protected target examples for all three SDKs (`examples/python_agent_nodes/permission_agent_a/`, `examples/go_agent_nodes/cmd/permission_caller/`, etc.)

- **Rate Limiting**: Added `express-rate-limit` to DID auth middleware on execution endpoints for TypeScript SDK. (6ffe576, 5cdfdf8)

- **`ExecuteError` Type**: All three SDKs now surface execution errors with status code and `error_details` propagation. (c5e5556)

### Fixed

- **Agent health status flapping** (#169): Three independent health systems (HealthMonitor, StatusManager, PresenceManager) fought each other. Now requires 3 consecutive failures before marking inactive, reduced heartbeat DB cache from 8s to 2s. (e74ed99)

- **Memory websocket blocking startup** (#165): websockets v14+ renamed `additional_headers` to `extra_headers`, and blocking reconnect prevented uvicorn from starting. Added 5s timeout and backgrounded reconnect. (4a63bec)

- **Python SDK hardcoded version** (#166): Registration payload hardcoded version to "1.0.0" and omitted agent metadata. Now passes actual values. (35d2685)

- **Async execution polling missing auth headers** (#180): `_poll_single_execution` and `_batch_poll_executions` did not include auth headers, causing 401 errors. (26692de)

- **Re-approval deadlock**: Re-approval only triggered for empty status, not revoked/rejected. Also fixed empty `caller_agent_id` and error propagation (200 → 502 for agent-to-agent failures). (c5e5556)

- **Permissions/versioning flow**: Removed `DenyAnonymous` (broke backward compat), preserved approved tags during re-registration, cleaned stale empty-version DB rows. (f9d9dcf)

- **UI workflow delete 404** (#174): Cleanup route was not registered. (ee47f56)

- **Workflow cleanup orphaned summaries** (#177): Deletion left behind orphaned run summaries. (ab2ce92)

- **Missing DeleteAgentVersion stub**: CI failure from missing interface method and postgres migration on fresh DBs. (4f7fe7a)

- **Reasoner name mismatch**: Python SDK used `func_name` instead of `reasoner_id` for endpoint path. (f427b9b)

- **Reasoner path normalization**: Added execution status guards for `waiting` state, approval expiration, execution event streaming. (f7a4a4d)

- **Duplicate `countWorkflowRuns`**: Removed duplicate method from rebase. (27455d7)

- **Pydantic formatting**: Fixed AI response formatting in Python SDK. (6a09ce0)

### Changed

- Database schema uses composite primary key `(id, version)` for agent nodes (migration 015)
- `AgentNode` type includes new fields: `GroupID`, `TrafficWeight`
- `StorageProvider` interface expanded with version-aware methods
- Discovery response includes `GroupID` in `AgentCapability`

## [0.1.42] - 2026-02-27


### Fixed

- Fix(release): add [skip ci] to version bump commit to prevent infinite loop (#194)

The release workflow pushes a version bump commit to main, which
triggers another release workflow run, creating an infinite loop.
Adding [skip ci] to the commit message prevents the pushed commit
from triggering any workflows.

### Chores

- Chore: remove redundant CLA assistant workflow (#192)

The contributor-assistant/github-action workflow requires a PAT to
store signatures in the remote .github repo, which is not configured.
The hosted cla-assistant.io integration (license/cla) is already
active and working, making this workflow redundant.

- Chore: add CLA assistant workflow (abd1d79)

- Chore: add CODEOWNERS with AbirAbbas as default reviewer (0ea7a8c)



### Fixed

- Fix(release): use deploy key to bypass branch protection on push (#193)

The release workflow pushes version bump commits directly to main,
which is blocked by the new branch ruleset requiring PRs. Use a
deploy key (which is in the ruleset bypass list) instead of the
default GITHUB_TOKEN.

## [Unreleased]

### Testing

- Test(web-ui): set up vitest testing infrastructure (#103)

Add unit testing infrastructure to the Web UI (`control-plane/web/client/`),
which previously had zero test coverage.

- Install vitest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom,
  @testing-library/user-event, @vitest/coverage-v8, and jsdom as devDependencies
- Add `vitest.config.ts` with jsdom environment, `@` path alias, and v8 coverage provider
- Add `src/test/setup.ts` to extend vitest with jest-dom matchers
- Add `src/test/components/status/StatusBadge.test.tsx` with comprehensive tests:
    - All `AgentState`, `HealthStatus`, and `LifecycleStatus` values via `it.each`
    - Priority ordering between `state`, `healthStatus`, and `lifecycleStatus` props
    - `showIcon` behaviour and `size` prop smoke tests
    - `status` prop (AgentStatus object): `status.state`, `showHealthScore` percentage
      display, `state_transition` arrow label, and `animate-pulse` during transitions
    - Dedicated `AgentStateBadge`, `HealthStatusBadge`, `LifecycleStatusBadge` exports
    - `getHealthScoreColor` utility — boundary tests across all four score tiers
    - `getHealthScoreBadgeVariant` utility — returns correct badge variant per tier
- Add `test`, `test:watch`, and `test:coverage` scripts to package.json
- Wire `npm run test` into `scripts/test-all.sh` alongside the existing lint step

## [0.1.42-rc.4] - 2026-02-27


### Chores

- Chore(web-ui): remove dead filter components (#190)

Remove 9 unused files that are not imported anywhere in the app.
The Executions page uses PageHeader with FilterSelect dropdowns,
not these legacy toggle-button filter components.

Removed files:
- ExecutionFilters.tsx, ExecutionsList.tsx, QuickFilters.tsx
- SearchWithFilters.tsx, SuggestedFilters.tsx, FilterTag.tsx
- hooks/useFilterState.ts, utils/filterUtils.ts, types/filters.ts

### Added

- Feat(python-sdk): add domain-specific exception hierarchy (#187)

* feat(python-sdk): add domain-specific exception hierarchy

* fix(python-sdk): harden exception wrapping and add tests

- Add double-wrap guards (except MemoryAccessError: raise) in all
  memory.py methods so MemoryAccessError never gets re-wrapped
- Wrap bare re-raises in client.py async methods (poll, batch_check,
  wait_for_result, cancel, list, metrics, cleanup) as
  AgentFieldClientError to match their documented Raises contracts
- Broaden register_node catch to Exception (catches JSONDecodeError
  in addition to requests.RequestException)
- Add 45 tests covering hierarchy, imports, client errors,
  registration, execution timeout, validation, memory wrapping,
  and double-wrap prevention

### Fixed

- Fix(control-plane): resolve agent node health status flapping (#169)

* fix(control-plane): resolve agent node health status flapping (#167)

Three independent health systems (HealthMonitor, StatusManager, PresenceManager)
were fighting each other, causing nodes to flicker between online/stale/offline.

Root causes fixed:
- Single HTTP failure instantly marked nodes inactive (now requires 3 consecutive failures)
- Heartbeats silently dropped for 10s after health check marked node inactive (removed)
- 30s recovery debounce blocked legitimate recovery (reduced to configurable 5s)
- 8s heartbeat DB cache caused phantom staleness (reduced to 2s)
- 30s reconciliation threshold too aggressive with cache delay (increased to 60s)

Changes:
- health_monitor.go: Add consecutive failure tracking, recovery debounce, sync.Once for Stop()
- status_manager.go: Remove heartbeat-dropping logic, configurable stale threshold
- config.go: Add NodeHealthConfig with env var overrides
- nodes.go: Reduce heartbeat cache from 8s to 2s
- server.go: Wire config into health monitor and status manager
- NodesPage.tsx: Add 30s background refresh for fresh timestamps

Tests: 10 new tests (5 unit + 3 integration + 2 status manager) all passing.
Integration tests wire all 3 services concurrently to validate no-flapping behavior.

* fix(control-plane): harden health monitor against races, flapping, and stale MCP data

Code review follow-up for #167. Addresses race conditions, missing MCP
health refresh, and test reliability issues found during review.

Key fixes:
- Eliminate stale pointer race: checkAgentHealth now takes nodeID string
  instead of *ActiveAgent, re-fetching canonical state after HTTP call
- Fix MCP health going stale: active agents now refresh MCP data on every
  health check, not only on status transitions
- Initialize LastTransition on registration so debounce has a valid baseline
- Cap consecutive failure counter to prevent unbounded growth
- Add lifecycle guard to NodesPage polling to prevent React state updates
  after unmount
- Fix RecoverFromDatabase tests that raced against async goroutine
- Extract health score magic numbers into named constants
- Document zero-value-means-default semantics on NodeHealthConfig

Tests: 30/30 health monitor + 3/3 integration tests pass

### Performance

- Perf(ci): speed up functional tests with parallel execution and faster health checks (#159)

- Add pytest-xdist for parallel test execution (-n auto)
- Reduce health check timing from 60*2s=120s to 30*1s=30s max wait
- Control plane typically starts in ~10-15s, so 30s is sufficient headroom

These are safe, non-cache-related optimizations that should reduce
functional test CI time by ~30-60 seconds without changing test logic.

The registration payload hardcoded version to "1.0.0" and did not include

Also fixes hardcoded sdk_version in deployment tags to use the real package
version from agentfield.__version__.

### Fixed

- Fix(sdk/python): prevent memory event websocket from blocking agent startup (#165)

* fix(sdk/python): support websockets v14+ in memory event client

websockets v14+ renamed the `additional_headers` parameter to
`extra_headers`. Since the SDK does not pin a websockets version,
users installing fresh get v14+ and hit:

  create_connection() got an unexpected keyword argument 'additional_headers'

This causes the memory event websocket connection to fail during
agent startup, and the blocking reconnect retry loop (exponential
backoff up to 31s) prevents uvicorn from completing initialization.

- Detect websockets major version at import time and use the correct
  parameter name (extra_headers for v14+, additional_headers for older)
- Update unit test mock to accept either parameter name

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix(sdk/python): prevent memory event connection from blocking agent startup

When the control plane websocket is unreachable, the memory event client's
connect() method would block indefinitely during FastAPI startup due to
exponential backoff retries (up to 31s). This prevented uvicorn from ever
binding to its port.

- Add 5s timeout to initial websocket connection attempt
- Background the reconnect retry loop so startup completes immediately
- Remove incorrect websockets version detection (additional_headers is
  correct for all modern versions v13+)

* test(sdk/python): add tests for websockets version compat and non-blocking reconnect

- Test that v14+ uses additional_headers parameter

* test(sdk/python): use CI matrix for websockets version compat testing

Replace monkeypatched version tests with real version detection tests
that validate against the actually installed websockets library. Add a

websockets 12.0 (extra_headers) and 15.0.1 (additional_headers) in
parallel.

When auth is enabled, accessing localhost:8080 directly would return
{"error":"unauthorized"} instead of redirecting to /ui/ where the
React app prompts for the API key.

The fix adds "/" to the auth middleware's skip list. This is safe
because the root path only performs a redirect to /ui/ - no data
is exposed.

### Fixed

- Fix(sdk): prevent WebSocket socket leak in MemoryEventClient (#157)

* fix(sdk): prevent WebSocket socket leak in MemoryEventClient

The MemoryEventClient had several issues causing socket leaks:

1. connect() didn't close the previous WebSocket before creating a new one
2. Both 'error' and 'close' events triggered reconnect, causing duplicates
3. No guard against concurrent reconnect scheduling

This fix:
- Adds cleanup() method to properly terminate and remove listeners
- Adds reconnectPending flag to prevent duplicate reconnect scheduling
- Cleans up existing WebSocket before creating a new one
- Uses ws.terminate() for forceful socket closure

This was causing the agent process to accumulate thousands of open
socket file descriptors, eventually exhausting ephemeral ports and
causing EADDRNOTAVAIL errors.

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>

* Consolidate HTTP agents and fix socket leak cleanup

This commit addresses additional socket leak issues discovered during
investigation of the WebSocket memory leak:

1. Consolidated HTTP agents into shared module (utils/httpAgents.ts)
   - Previously each client file (AgentFieldClient, MemoryClient,
     DidClient, MCPClient) created its own HTTP agent pair
   - Now all clients share a single pair of agents
   - Reduces memory overhead and ensures consistent connection pooling

2. Fixed setTimeout tracking in MemoryEventClient
   - Added reconnectTimer property to store timeout ID
   - Clear timeout in cleanup() to prevent orphaned timers
   - Prevents potential timer leaks during rapid connect/disconnect

3. Added clear() method to MCPClientRegistry
   - Allows proper cleanup of registered MCP clients

4. Increased memory test threshold from 12MB to 25MB
   - CI environments show higher variance in GC timing
   - Local tests show ~5MB growth, well within threshold

### Fixed

- Fix: add maxTotalSockets to prevent socket exhaustion across IPv4/IPv6 (#156)

The previous fix with maxSockets only limited connections per-host, but
Railway's internal DNS returns both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses which are
treated as separate hosts. This caused connections to grow unbounded.

Adding maxTotalSockets: 50 limits total connections across ALL hosts,
properly preventing socket exhaustion in dual-stack environments.

Changes:
- Add maxTotalSockets: 50 to all http.Agent instances
- Remove deprecated timeout option from http.Agent
- Bump SDK version to 0.1.35
- Update init-example to use 0.1.35

### Performance

- Perf: Python SDK memory optimization + benchmark visualization improvements (#138)

* feat(benchmarks): add 100K scale benchmark suite

- Go SDK: 100K handlers in 16.4ms, 8.1M req/s throughput
- Python SDK benchmark with memory profiling
- LangChain baseline for comparison
- Seaborn visualizations for technical documentation

Results demonstrate Go SDK advantages:
- ~3,000x faster registration than LangChain at scale
- ~32x more memory efficient per handler
- ~520x higher theoretical throughput

* fix(sdk/python): optimize memory usage - 97% reduction vs baseline

Memory optimizations for Python SDK to significantly reduce memory footprint:

## Changes

### async_config.py
- Reduce result_cache_ttl: 600s -> 120s (2 min)
- Reduce result_cache_max_size: 20000 -> 5000
- Reduce cleanup_interval: 30s -> 10s
- Reduce max_completed_executions: 4000 -> 1000
- Reduce completed_execution_retention_seconds: 600s -> 60s

### client.py
- Add shared HTTP session pool (_shared_sync_session) for connection reuse
- Replace per-request Session creation with class-level shared session
- Add _init_shared_sync_session() and _get_sync_session() class methods
- Reduces connection overhead and memory from session objects

### execution_state.py
- Clear input_data after execution completion (set_result)
- Clear input_data after execution failure (set_error)
- Clear input_data after cancellation (cancel)
- Clear input_data after timeout (timeout_execution)
- Prevents large payloads from being retained in memory

### async_execution_manager.py
- Add 1MB buffer limit for SSE event stream
- Prevents unbounded buffer growth from malformed events

## Benchmark Results

Memory comparison (1000 iterations, ~10KB payloads):
- Baseline pattern: 47.76 MB (48.90 KB/iteration)
- Optimized SDK:     1.30 MB (1.33 KB/iteration)
- Improvement:      97.3% memory reduction

Added benchmark scripts for validation:
- memory_benchmark.py: Component-level memory testing
- benchmark_comparison.py: Full comparison with baseline patterns

* refactor(sdk): convert memory benchmarks to proper test suites

Replace standalone benchmark scripts with proper test suite integration:

## Python SDK
- Remove benchmark_comparison.py and memory_benchmark.py
- Add tests/test_memory_performance.py with pytest integration
- Tests cover AsyncConfig defaults, ExecutionState memory clearing,
  ResultCache bounds, and client session reuse
- Includes baseline comparison and memory regression tests

## Go SDK
- Add agent/memory_performance_test.go
- Benchmarks for InMemoryBackend Set/Get/List operations
- Memory efficiency tests with performance reporting
- ClearScope memory release verification (96.9% reduction)

## TypeScript SDK
- Add tests/memory_performance.test.ts with Vitest
- Agent creation and registration efficiency tests
- Large payload handling tests
- Memory leak prevention tests

All tests verify memory-optimized defaults and proper cleanup.

* feat(benchmarks): update with TypeScript SDK and optimized Python SDK

- Add TypeScript SDK benchmark (50K handlers in 16.7ms)
- Re-run all benchmarks with PR #137 Python memory optimizations
- Fix Go memory measurement to use HeapAlloc delta
- Regenerate all visualizations with seaborn

Results:
- Go: 100K handlers in 17.3ms, 280 bytes/handler, 8.2M req/s
- TypeScript: 50K handlers in 16.7ms, 276 bytes/handler
- Python SDK: 5K handlers in 2.97s, 127 MB total
- LangChain: 1K tools in 483ms, 10.8 KB/tool

* perf(python-sdk): optimize startup with lazy loading and add MCP/DID flags

Improvements:
- Implement lazy LiteLLM import in agent_ai.py (saves 10-20MB if AI not used)
- Add lazy loading for ai_handler and cli_handler properties
- Add enable_mcp (default: False) and enable_did (default: True) flags
- MCP disabled by default since not yet fully supported

Benchmark methodology fixes:
- Separate Agent init time from handler registration time
- Measure handler memory independently from Agent overhead
- Increase test scale to 10K handlers (from 5K)

Results:
- Agent Init: 1.07 ms (one-time overhead)
- Agent Memory: 0.10 MB (one-time overhead)
- Cold Start: 1.39 ms (Agent + 1 handler)
- Handler Registration: 0.58 ms/handler
- Handler Memory: 26.4 KB/handler (Pydantic + FastAPI overhead)
- Request Latency p99: 0.17 µs
- Throughput: 7.5M req/s (single-threaded theoretical)

* perf(python-sdk): Reduce per-handler memory from 26.4 KB to 7.4 KB

Architectural changes to reduce memory footprint:

1. Consolidated registries: Replace 3 separate data structures (reasoners list,
   _reasoner_vc_overrides, _reasoner_return_types) with single Dict[str, ReasonerEntry]
   using __slots__ dataclasses.

2. Removed Pydantic create_model(): Each handler was creating a Pydantic model
   class (~1.5-2 KB overhead). Now use runtime validation via _validate_handler_input()
   with type coercion support.

3. On-demand schema generation: Schemas are now generated only when the
   /discover endpoint is called, not stored per-handler. Added _types_to_json_schema()
   and _type_to_json_schema() helper methods.

4. Weakref closures: Use weakref.ref(self) in tracked_func closure to break
   circular references (Agent → tracked_func → Agent) and enable immediate GC.

Benchmark results (10,000 handlers):
- Memory: 26.4 KB/handler → 7.4 KB/handler (72% reduction)
- Registration: 5,797 ms → 624 ms

Also updated benchmark documentation to use neutral technical presentation
without comparative marketing language.

* ci: Redesign PR performance metrics for clarity and regression detection

Simplified the memory-metrics.yml workflow to be scannable and actionable:

- Single clean table instead of 4 collapsible sections
- Delta (Δ) column shows change from baseline
- Only runs benchmarks for affected SDKs (conditional execution)
- Threshold-based warnings: ⚠ at +10%, ✗ at +25% for memory
- Added baseline.json with current metrics for comparison

Example output:
| SDK    | Memory  | Δ    | Latency | Δ | Tests | Status |
|--------|---------|------|---------|---|-------|--------|
| Python | 7.4 KB  | -    | 0.21 µs | - | ✓     | ✓      |

✓ No regressions detected

* refactor(benchmarks): Consolidate visualization to 2 scientific figures

- Reduce from 6 images to 2 publication-quality figures
- benchmark_summary.png: 2x2 grid with registration, memory, latency, throughput
- latency_comparison.png: CDF and box plot with proper legends
- Fix Python SDK validation error handling (proper HTTP 422 responses)
- Update tests to use new _reasoner_registry (replaces _reasoner_return_types)
- Clean up unused benchmark result files

* fix(benchmarks): Re-run Python SDK benchmark with optimized code

- Updated AgentField_Python.json with fresh benchmark results
- Memory: 7.5 KB/handler (was 26.4 KB) - 30% better than LangChain
- Registration: 57ms for 1000 handlers (was 5796ms for 10000)
- Consolidated to single clean 2x2 visualization
- Removed comparative text, keeping neutral factual presentation

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* feat(benchmarks): Add Pydantic AI comparison, improve visualization

- Add Pydantic AI benchmark (3.4 KB/handler, 0.17µs latency, 9M rps)
- Update color scheme: AgentField SDKs in blue family, others distinct
- Shows AgentField crushing LangChain on key metrics:
  - Latency: 0.21µs vs 118µs (560x faster)
  - Throughput: 6.7M vs 15K (450x higher)
  - Registration: 57ms vs 483ms (8x faster)

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* chore(benchmarks): Remove Pydantic AI and CrewAI, keep only LangChain comparison

- Remove pydantic-ai-bench/ directory
- Remove crewai-bench/ directory
- Remove PydanticAI_Python.json results
- Update analyze.py to only include AgentField SDKs + LangChain

* ci fixes

* fix: Python 3.8/3.9 compatibility for dataclass slots parameter

The `slots=True` parameter for dataclass was added in Python 3.10.
This fix conditionally applies slots only on Python 3.10+, maintaining
backward compatibility with Python 3.8 and 3.9 while preserving the
memory optimization on newer versions.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix(ci): Fix TypeScript benchmark and update baseline for CI environment

- Fix TypeScript benchmark failing due to top-level await in CJS mode
  - Changed from npx tsx -e to writing .mjs file and running with node
  - Now correctly reports memory (~219 B/handler) and latency metrics

- Update baseline.json to match CI environment (Python 3.11, ubuntu-latest)
  - Python baseline: 7.4 KB → 9.0 KB (reflects actual CI measurements)
  - Increased warning thresholds to 15% to account for cross-platform variance
  - The previous baseline was from Python 3.14/macOS which differs from CI

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix(ci): TypeScript benchmark now tests actual SDK instead of raw Map

The CI benchmark was incorrectly measuring a raw JavaScript Map instead
of the actual TypeScript SDK. This fix:

- Adds npm build step before benchmark
- Uses actual Agent class with agent.reasoner() registration
- Measures real SDK overhead (Agent + ReasonerRegistry)
- Updates baseline: 276 → 350 bytes/handler (actual SDK overhead)
- Aligns handler count with Python (1000) for consistency

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* feat(benchmarks): Add CrewAI and Mastra framework comparisons

Add benchmark comparisons for CrewAI (Python) and Mastra (TypeScript):
- CrewAI: AgentField is 3.5x faster registration, 1.9x less memory
- Mastra: AgentField is 27x faster registration, 6.5x less memory

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* docs: Add SDK performance benchmarks to README

Add benchmark comparison tables for Python (vs LangChain, CrewAI) and
TypeScript (vs Mastra) frameworks showing registration time, memory
per handler, and throughput metrics.

### Added

- Feat(ci): add contributor reminder and assignment tracking workflows (#132)

Add automated system to remind assigned contributors and free up stale assignments:

- contributor-reminders.yml: Scheduled daily check that:
  - Sends friendly reminder at 7 days without activity
  - Sends second reminder at 14 days with unassign warning
  - Unassigns and re-labels as 'help wanted' at 21 days
  - Skips issues with linked PRs or blocking labels
  - Supports dry-run mode for testing

- issue-assignment-tracking.yml: Real-time event handling that:
  - Welcomes new assignees with timeline expectations
  - Clears reminder labels when assignees comment
  - Clears labels when assignee opens linked PR
  - Auto-adds 'help wanted' when last assignee leaves

This improves contributor experience by setting clear expectations
while ensuring stale assignments don't block other contributors. (7bbac52)

## [0.1.28-rc.3] - 2026-01-05


### Fixed

- Fix(control-plane): enforce lifecycle_status consistency with agent state (#130)

When agents go offline, the control plane was incorrectly keeping
lifecycle_status as "ready" even though health_status correctly showed
"inactive". This caused observability webhooks to receive inconsistent
data where offline nodes appeared online based on lifecycle_status.

Changes:
- Add defensive lifecycle_status enforcement in persistStatus()
  to ensure consistency with agent state before writing to storage
- Update health_monitor.go fallback paths to also update lifecycle_status
- Add SystemStateSnapshot event type for periodic agent inventory
- Enhance execution events with full reasoner context and metadata
- Add ListAgents to ObservabilityWebhookStore interface for snapshots

The fix ensures both node_offline events and system_state_snapshot
events (every 60s) correctly report lifecycle_status: "offline" for
offline agents.

Fixed a race condition where node offline events were not being forwarded
to the observability webhook. The issue was in UpdateAgentStatus which
called GetAgentStatus (performing a live health check) to get the "old"
status. By the time the health check completed, oldStatus == newStatus,
so no events were broadcast.

Changed to use GetAgentStatusSnapshot which returns cached/stored status
without a live check, preserving the true "old" state for comparison.

### Other

- Fix parent-child workflow tracking for direct reasoner calls via AgentRouter (#86)

* Fix parent-child workflow tracking for direct reasoner calls via AgentRouter

When reasoners registered via AgentRouter call other reasoners directly
(as normal async functions), the parent-child relationship was not being
captured in the workflow DAG. This happened because:

1. @router.reasoner() stored the original function but returned it unchanged
2. When include_router() later wrapped functions with tracking, closures in
   other reasoners still held references to the original unwrapped functions
3. Direct calls bypassed the tracked wrapper entirely

This fix implements lazy-binding in AgentRouter.reasoner():
- The decorator now returns a wrapper that looks up the tracked function
  at call time via router._tracked_functions
- include_router() registers tracked functions in this lookup table
- Direct reasoner-to-reasoner calls now go through the tracked wrapper,
  enabling proper parent_execution_id propagation

Changes:
- router.py: Add lazy-binding wrapper in reasoner() decorator
- agent.py: Register tracked functions in router._tracked_functions
- test_router.py: Update tests for new wrapper behavior
- test_workflow_parent_child.py: Add comprehensive tests for parent-child tracking

* Remove unused imports in test_workflow_parent_child.py (342af92)

### Other

- Deployments: Docker/Helm/Kustomize quickstarts + demo agents (#81)

* Update Docker deployment and configuration

Refactors the Docker deployment documentation and configuration to improve clarity and flexibility for setting up control planes and agents.

Key changes include:
- Enhancing the README for Docker deployments with more detailed instructions for running agents in Docker, distinguishing between agents on the host and agents within the same Docker Compose network.
- Adding specific guidance on using `host.docker.internal` for host-based agents and service names for agents within the same network.
- Introducing new Docker Compose services for a demo Go agent and a demo Python agent, enabling them to be run with Docker Compose profiles.
- Updating configuration options in `control-plane/internal/config/config.go` to include `mapstructure` tags, improving the flexibility of configuration loading.
- Adding a new test case `TestLoadConfig_VCRequirementsFromConfigFile` to verify loading VC requirements from a configuration file.
- Modifying the Python hello world example to use an environment variable for the AgentField server URL, making it more adaptable to different deployment scenarios.
- Updating the Dockerized README to include validation steps for execution paths and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).

* Update deployment documentation and manifests

Updates the README files for Docker, Helm, and Kubernetes deployments to improve clarity and provide more streamlined quick-start guides.

The changes include:
- Simplifying the Docker Compose setup instructions.
- Refining the Helm chart documentation to recommend PostgreSQL and the Python demo agent by default.
- Streamlining the Kubernetes manifests to suggest the Python demo agent overlay as a recommended starting point.
- Modifying the Python demo agent deployment in Kubernetes to directly install the AgentField SDK from PyPI instead of relying on a pre-built local image. This simplifies the local development workflow for the Python agent.

* Update documentation for deployment examples

Adds instructions for waiting for demo agents to become ready and for building/loading the Go demo agent image with Minikube.

Also includes an example of how to use the API key when authentication is enabled.

Updates the control plane deployment configuration to default `AGENTFIELD_CONFIG_FILE` to `/dev/null`.

Adjusts the kustomization file for the postgres demo overlay to use the standard `patches` key. (b6b0cd3)

### Fixed

- Fix: use executions table for notes storage instead of workflow_executions (#75)

* fix: use executions table for notes storage instead of workflow_executions

The note handlers (AddExecutionNoteHandler, GetExecutionNotesHandler) were
querying the workflow_executions table, but execution data is actually stored
in the executions table. This caused "execution not found" errors when adding
or retrieving notes via app.note().

Changes:
- Add Notes field to types.Execution struct
- Add notes column to ExecutionRecordModel (GORM auto-migrates this)
- Update SQL queries in execution_records.go to include notes column
- Update scanExecution to deserialize notes JSON
- Change ExecutionNoteStorage interface to use GetExecutionRecord and
  UpdateExecutionRecord instead of GetWorkflowExecution and
  UpdateWorkflowExecution
- Update AddExecutionNoteHandler to use UpdateExecutionRecord
- Update GetExecutionNotesHandler to use GetExecutionRecord

* feat: allow external contributors to run functional tests without API keys

Enable external contributors to run 92% of functional tests (24/26) without
requiring access to OpenRouter API keys. This makes it easier for the community
to contribute while maintaining full test coverage for maintainers.

Changes:
- Detect forked PRs and automatically skip OpenRouter-dependent tests
- Only 2 tests require OpenRouter (LLM integration tests)
- 24 tests validate all core infrastructure without LLM calls
- Update GitHub Actions workflow to conditionally set PYTEST_ARGS
- Update functional test README with clear documentation

Test coverage for external contributors:
✅ Control plane health and APIs
✅ Agent registration and discovery
✅ Multi-agent communication
✅ Memory system (all scopes)
✅ Workflow orchestration
✅ Go/TypeScript SDK integration
✅ Serverless agents
✅ Verifiable credentials

Skipped for external contributors (maintainers still run these):
⏭️  test_hello_world_with_openrouter
⏭️  test_readme_quick_start_summarize_flow

This change addresses the challenge of running CI for external contributors
without exposing repository secrets while maintaining comprehensive test
coverage for the core AgentField platform functionality.

* fix: handle push events correctly in functional tests workflow

The workflow was failing on push events (to main/testing branches) because
it relied on github.event.pull_request.head.repo.fork which is null for
push events. This caused the workflow to incorrectly fall into the else
branch and fail when OPENROUTER_API_KEY wasn't set.

Changes:
- Check github.event_name to differentiate between push, pull_request, and workflow_dispatch
- Explicitly handle push and workflow_dispatch events to run all tests with API key
- Preserve fork PR detection to skip OpenRouter tests for external contributors

Now properly handles:
✅ Fork PRs: Skip 2 OpenRouter tests, run 24/26 tests
✅ Internal PRs: Run all 26 tests with API key
✅ Push to main/testing: Run all 26 tests with API key
✅ Manual workflow dispatch: Run all 26 tests with API key

* fix: remove shell quoting from PYTEST_ARGS to prevent argument parsing errors

The PYTEST_ARGS variable contained single quotes around '-m "not openrouter" -v'
which would be included in the environment variable value. When passed to pytest
in the Docker container shell command, this caused the entire string to be treated
as a single argument instead of being properly split into separate arguments.

Changed from: '-m "not openrouter" -v'
Changed to:   -m not openrouter -v

This allows the shell's word splitting to correctly parse the arguments when
pytest $$PYTEST_ARGS is evaluated in the docker-compose command.

* refactor: separate pytest marker expression from general args for proper quoting

The previous approach of embedding -m not openrouter inside PYTEST_ARGS was
fragile because shell word-splitting doesn't guarantee "not openrouter" stays
together as a single argument to the -m flag.

This change introduces PYTEST_MARK_EXPR as a dedicated variable for the marker
expression, which is then properly quoted when passed to pytest:
  pytest -m "$PYTEST_MARK_EXPR" $PYTEST_ARGS ...

Benefits:
- Marker expression is guaranteed to be treated as single argument to -m
- Clear separation between marker selection and general pytest args
- More maintainable for future marker additions
- Eliminates shell quoting ambiguity

Changes:
- workflow: Split PYTEST_ARGS into PYTEST_MARK_EXPR + PYTEST_ARGS
- docker-compose: Add PYTEST_MARK_EXPR env var and conditional -m flag
- docker-compose: Only apply -m when PYTEST_MARK_EXPR is non-empty

### Fixed

- Fix(python-sdk): move conditional imports to module level (#72)

The `serve()` method had `import os` and `import urllib.parse` statements
inside conditional blocks. When an explicit port was passed, the first
conditional block was skipped, but Python's scoping still saw the later
conditional imports, causing an `UnboundLocalError` when trying to use
`os.getenv()` at line 1140.

Error seen in Docker containers:
```
UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'os' where it is not
associated with a value
```

This worked locally because `auto_port=True` executed the first code path
which included `import os`, but failed in Docker when passing an explicit
port value.

Fix: Move all imports to module level where they belong.

- Fix(example): use IPv4 binding for documentation-chatbot

The documentation chatbot was binding to `::` (IPv6 all interfaces) which
causes Railway internal networking to fail with "connection refused" since
Railway routes traffic over IPv4.

Removed explicit host parameter to use the SDK default of `0.0.0.0` which
binds to IPv4 all interfaces.

- Feat(sdk-python): expose execution context via app.ctx property

Add a `ctx` property to the Agent class that provides direct access to
the current execution context during reasoner/skill execution. This
enables a more ergonomic API:

Before:
  from agentfield.execution_context import get_current_context
  ctx = get_current_context()
  workflow_id = ctx.workflow_id

After:
  workflow_id = app.ctx.workflow_id

The property returns None when accessed outside of an active execution
(e.g., at module level or after a request completes), matching the
behavior of app.memory. This prevents accidental use of stale or
placeholder context data.

Also fixes integration test fixtures to support the current monorepo
structure where control-plane lives at repo root instead of
apps/platform/agentfield.

- Restructuring and clarifying the prompt instructions for citations, providing explicit guidance on how to use and format them.
- Enhancing the citation key map format to be more descriptive and user-friendly for the LLM.
- Explicitly stating that the `citations` array in the response should be left empty by the LLM, as it will be injected by the system.
- Updating the `Citation` schema to correctly reflect that the `key` should not include brackets.
- Adding a specific "REFINEMENT MODE" instruction to the refined prompt to guide the LLM's behavior in a second retrieval attempt.
- Minor cleanup and adjustments to prompt text for better readability. (56246ad)

- Update dependencies for improved compatibility

Updates several npm package dependencies, including browserslist, caniuse-lite, and electron-to-chromium, to their latest versions.
This ensures better compatibility and incorporates recent improvements and bug fixes from these packages. (c72278c)

- Implement automatic agent method delegation

Improves the AgentRouter by implementing __getattr__ to automatically delegate any unknown attribute or method access to the attached agent. This eliminates the need for explicit delegation methods for agent functionalities like `ai()`, `call()`, `memory`, `note()`, and `discover()`.

This change simplifies the AgentRouter's interface and makes it more transparently proxy agent methods. Added tests to verify the automatic delegation for various agent methods and property access, as well as error handling when no agent is attached. (26c9288)
